                            COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild-to-severe, including illness resulting in death. Most COVID-19 illness is mild, 
                            serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. Older people and people of all 
                            ages with severe, chronic medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher 
                            risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.<br><br>
    
                            Both the Pfizer COVID-19 pill and the Merck COVID-19 pill are FDA authorized that can be taken at home. The Pfizer COVID 
                            medication, Paxlovid, is taken twice daily for 5 days.  The Merck COVID pill is taken twice a day, for 5 days. Both medications 
                            must be taken within 5 days of COVID symptom onset in order to be effective.<br><br>
